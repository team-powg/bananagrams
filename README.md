Bananagrams

Bananagrams is our team's take on the popular real game, Bananagrams. Players can create a new game ready for up to four players or join an existing game.  At the start of a game, all players get 21 random tiles from a shared pot of 144 tiles. Players must race to spell valid words on their board and use up all of their alloted tiles before their opponents.  

When a player's hand is empty, they can use the "PEEL" button to grab a new tile from the shared pot and also force every other player to receive an additional tile.  Once the player's hand and the shared pot are empty, that player can hit the "Submit" button to win the game.  During gameplay, every player is able to see every other player's boards on their screen to gauge where they stand in the exciting race of tiles.
